# Lab2: Spark

This lab demonstrates 
- Workflow with hive and iceberg catalogs to handle different workflows.
- Support for data federation so that data can be consumed from the source rather than making additional copies. 
- Using the fit for purpose engine (Spark) to Transform, aggregate and cleanse the data in-order to expose high quality data for Analytical and AI applications.
