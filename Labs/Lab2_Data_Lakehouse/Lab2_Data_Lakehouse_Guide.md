## 1. Introduction

The :dart: **purpose** of this Lab is to demonstrate:
- Workflow with hive and iceberg catalogs to handle different data tasks.
- Support for data federation so that data can be consumed from the source rather than making additional copies. 
- Using the fit for purpose engine (Spark) to Transform, aggregate and cleanse the data in-order to expose high quality data for Analytical and AI applications.


#### Presto
In `Presto data insertion` you will first :memo: register data located in hive bucket to hive catalog as external tables, then :inbox_tray: ingest some of the data into iceberg catalog (accounts table) associated with the presto engine. 


#### Spark
In the Spark steps `Spark pre-processing` you will prepare holdings table :clipboard: for 2024 and particular stocks based on tables offloaded in Lab 1 from Netezza. Then holdings for 2024 will be combined with holdings up to 2023 containing pre-defined set of stocks to get total `holdings_table` that will later be used along with `accounts_table` in Agentic Flow. Postgres `bankdemo.customers_table` is federated to watsonx.data `postgres_catalog` as part of the pre-requisites and does not require any additional changes and will be used AS IS in Agentic Flow.

## 2.  Prerequisites
- Completed  [Environment Setup](env-setup/wealth-mgr-env-setup.md)
- Moderator uploaded files to hive bucket
- `env.txt` uploaded into the project
- Completed [Lab 1](../Lab1_Data_Warehouse_Optimization/Lab_1_Data_Offload_Guide.md).



## 3. Data overview

![](attachments/2025-04-30-17-06-15-pasted-vscode.png)

**:card_file_box: Sources of data**

- files in COS hive bucket
  - Go to your COS instance https://cloud.ibm.com/objectstorage/instances -> select bucket that starts with `hive` like `hive-1753085729998611476` -> search for `input_data_hive` directory, there you should find folders/files that were pre-uploaded for you by moderator, if not raise concerns:
    - `accounts_ht` contains the list of account ids and customer ids from the internal system dump;
    - `holdings_ht`contains information on accounts and their stock holdings (unique by account_id and asset_ticker) for the previous period up to 2023, where `asset_ticker` is stock symbol, `holding_amt` is the total amount of a particular stock and `tax_liability` is the remaining tax liability still owed;
    - `tax_liability_ht` contains country specific tax rate;
- watsonx.data schema
  - `iceberg_data.<SCHEMA_DWH_OFFLOAD>` contains data offloaded from Netezza;
  - `postgres_catalog.bankdemo.customers_table` is a federated postgres table that contains customer data.
  
## 4. Expected outcome

At the end of the lab you should have 2 tables in  `clients_schema_YourName_First3LettersOfSurname` prepared that will be later used by an agentic flow in Lab5.
