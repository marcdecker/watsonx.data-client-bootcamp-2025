## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1 Clone the classroom Repo

Clone the classroom Repo via SSH  
:warning: Update the repo according to the classroom repo
```sh
git clone git@github.ibm.com:skol/watsonx.data-client-bootcamp-2025.git
```

If you are not setup for SSH, you can download via Browser instead:

* Go to: <add url of repo>

* Click on Code, Download Zip  

<img src="./attachments/image3.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:2.94861in"
alt="A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect." />

### 1.2 Access your class Instance

For completing this bootcamp you will need the following services.
* watsonx.data
* Cloud Object Storage (COS)
* watsonx.data Intelligence
* watsonx.ai Studio & Runtime
* watsonx Orchestrate
  
A techzone instance with the required services been provided and shared with you.   

To access the environment, look for an email message from IBM Technology Zone <noreply@techzone.ibm.com> inviting you to join the account where your class environment is located.  

In the email, Click on the `HERE` link to accept the invitation
(Highlighted in the screenshot below.)

<img src="./attachments/image4.png"
style="width:3.99858in;height:4.70288in"
alt="A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect." />

Option: If you miss the email or don't receive it for any reason, you
can find the invitation on your IBM Cloud account:
<https://cloud.ibm.com/notifications?type=account>

Please select the **Join Now** link.

<img src="./attachments/image5.png"
style="width:4.96851in;height:2.75537in"
alt="A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect." />

*You might have earlier worked with the same Techzone account / have access to it and you are able to see it in the list of your accounts in IBM Cloud. In that case, select it and check the list of available services for the current reservtion (based on the Group ID and Environment id in Techzone).*


### 1.3 Open your Techzone Reservation 

* Go to your techzone reservation list:
<https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations>

* Look for your recently created reservation and click "Open this
environment".

* Scroll down and look for the name of the Cloud Account (should be
watsonx-events or watsonx-events2)

<img src="./attachments/image6.png"
style="width:5.33333in;height:2.875in"
alt="A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect." />

### 1.4 Login to your Techzone environment 

* Go to: <https://cloud.ibm.com/resources>

* Login with your IBM credentials

### 1.5 Verify you are in the right instance. 

Check at the top right that you are in the right instance â€“
**watsonx-events** or **watsonx-events2**

<img src="./attachments/image7.png"
style="width:6.30556in;height:0.98611in"
alt="A black and white stripe AI-generated content may be incorrect." />

If it does not show the right name of the instance, you can select it from the drop-down.

<font color="red">**CAUTION:**</font>  The instance at the top right tends to change to your default personal account every time you switch/go back to a new page. Thus, it's always good to check the top right corner **every time** you switch to a new page.

### 1.6 Open a Text Editor of your choice 

Open a text-based notepad to use as a ready reference for the lab.  The labs will have call outs to copy information that will be needed for future configuration steps.

Examples: Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac or use `.txt` file in VSCode.  
 

## 2. Configuring the Environment

### 2.1 Create an API key

From the IBM Cloud interface use the top menu
![Manage Access](./attachments/2025-04-23-11-24-04-pasted-vscode.png)
* Manage -> Access IAM 
* From the Left Navigation click Manage Identities -> API Keys
* Click on the Create button
* Name you key **lab-api-key** and click Create with the defaults
* Copy the key to your text Reference (you will use in a future step)
* Download the file to your laptop / desktop.

<img src="./attachments/image8.png"
style="width:4.58333in;height:2.125in"
alt="A screenshot of a computer error AI-generated content may be incorrect." />


1. Log in to watsonx<a name="log-in-to-watsonx"></a>
---
Go to `IBM Cloud` -> `Resource list` -> In `AI/ Machine Learning` resources find `watsonx.ai Studio` instance and click on it -> Launch in IBM watsonx
![](./attachments/2025-04-23-17-33-42-pasted-vscode.png)


2. Check that you are in the right account and location <a name="check-instance"></a>
---
You should now be taken to the watsonx home screen. Check at the top right that you are in the right account and location (specified for your Labs account). If it does not show the right name of the account, you can select it in the dropdown. For the entirety of the bootcamp, you will be working in that same account and location!

If you do not know your account, go to your techzone reservations list https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations. Look for your recently created reservation and click on "Open this environment". Scroll down and look for a reservation name that looks similar to this:  `2709027 - watsonx-events`. 

**Note:** The account at the top right tends to change to your default personal account every time you switch/go back to a new page. Thus, it's always good to check the top right corner every time you switch to a new page.

![check-right-instance](./attachments/check-right-instance.png)


### 2.2 Create a new project<a name="new-project"></a>

1. On the homepage, capture the `watsonx.ai URL` and save to your text based reference, you will need this for your env.txt file.
2. Go to the **Projects** section at the bottom, and click the "+" symbol next to it to create a new project.

    ![create-new-project](./attachments/2025-07-13_08-30-16.png)

3. Enter a **unique name** for your project, include both your first and last name and any other information you would like.

    ![unique-name](./attachments/unique-name.png)

    **Cloud Object Storage (COS)**
    It is likely there is also already a Cloud Object Storage instance selected for you, with a name that starts with "itzcos-..." If so, you don't have to do anything! 

    Otherwise you may be prompted to select from multiple instances. Please consult with your bootcamp lead which COS instance to select.

    ![select-instance](./attachments/select-instance.png)

4. Click Create to create the project. It may take a few seconds to officially be created.

5. Copy the `Project ID` to your text reference, you will need it for your Env file:
![](./attachments/projectid.png)

1. Return to the watsonx.ai Studio homepage 


### 2.3 Associate a watsonx.ai Runtime instance<a name="wml-instance"></a>
---
1.  Go to the `Manage` tab
2.  Click on `Services and Integrations` in the left side-bar.  
3.  Click on `Associate service`

![manage-tab](./attachments/manage-tab.png)

4. Select the service listed with "Type" = `watsonx.ai Runtime` and click **Associate**. 

![associate-wml](./attachments/2025-06-25-11-10-43-pasted-vscode.png)

**Note:** If you can't find the service, remove all filters from the "Locations" and "Resource Groups" dropdown. If you see 2+ watsonx.ai Runtime services, select the one where "Group" = the same *environment* name of the instance. The *environment* name can be found on https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations. 

![techzone](./attachments/techzone.png)

### 2.4 Create a project token 

The Project token will be used by the notebook for accessing the assets in the project programatically. 

1. Go to the `Manage` tab
2. Under `Access Control` click on the `Access tokens` tab 
3. If you do not have a token, create one by selecting `New access token`
  ![project_token](./attachments/project_token.png)
4. Give it a name, select `Editor` for `Access Role` and select `Create`  
   ![project_token](./attachments/access_token.png)

### 2.5 Create a User API Key 

The User API Key is a prerequisite for successful remote deployment and accessing deployments from other services (e.g. watsonx Orchestrate). This key is different from the Cloud API key you previously created.  If you have one already, you are all set.  If you do not, follow the steps below to create it.

1. Go to `Profile and settings` for a given user (upper right corner with user initials) -> `User API Key` Tab:

4. From `Manage` tab copy `Space GUID` to the reference note as Deployment space id
![Deployment space id](./attachments/2025-04-25-16-15-12-pasted-vscode.png)

### 2.7 Prepare env.txt

1. Copy the template [env.example](../env.example) in the root folder with the name env.txt and open it in any text editor of your choice.

    ```
    cp "./env.example" "./.env.txt"
    ```

1. Update env.txt as follows
    ```
    # Spark Engine ID  -> Update with Engine ID provided by instructor
